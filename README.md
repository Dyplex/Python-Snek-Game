# Python Snek Game
Made for a college project! Everything in here is held together by duct tape and tears!  
Sorry in advance for the messy code ! - MaskMajor

# What is "Python Snek Game" ?
  A *simple* python game made in a week *(I think)* with a few cutsom features to make the gameplay more interesting !  
The game features a custom ranking system *(DMC inspired)* and le funny snake reactions to make everything more **ENTERTAINING** !  
And uh....unique? 

This project wouldn't have been possible without the help of [Codebro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfRwxS5d0SI&t=1s)! (Great coding totorials, go **sub**)

# How to setup the game
Requirements : 
1) A code editor (Anything works I think) ex.Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, VSCodium...
2) [Python](https://www.python.org/) - You CANNOT start editing the code without it
3) And all of this (For windows) :
```
  pip install requests
  pip install itertools
  pip install Pillow
  pip install pygame
  pip install opencv-python
```

# TO DO LIST 
Finished and unfinished things I wanted the game to have!

> Currently finished:
<p>1. Add audio and game icon
<p>5. Add custom textures to the snake and board (maybe change textures when reaching a specific puncte)
<p>4. Add DMC puncte system
<p>3. Modify interface
  
> WIP / Unfinished
<p>2. Add main menu (Settings, custom keybinds and volume slider)
<p>6. Make it so that the game moves faster if you have more puncte
<p>7. (Maybe) Clean the code
<p>8. (Maybe) Add a neato shader to the gaem
