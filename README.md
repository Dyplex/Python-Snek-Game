# Python Snek Game :snake:
Made for a college project! Everything in here is held together by duct tape and tears!  
Sorry in advance for the messy code ! - MaskMajor\

Also if it gives you a virus pop-up, ignore it, it's not a virus. Python programs just dont do well when they are turned into .exe files or something like that. Come to think of it most .exe files make
antiviruses go wild, meh ;p

# What is "Python Snek Game" ? :thinking:
  A *simple* python game made in a week *(I think)* with a few cutsom features to make the gameplay more interesting !  
The game features a custom ranking system *(DMC inspired)* and le funny snake reactions to make everything more **ENTERTAINING** !  
And uh....unique? 

# Credits !! :computer:

+ Also HUGE thanks to that one guy in the [Python Discord server](https://discord.gg/python) for helping me figure out how to make the gifs work  
+ And thank you to [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) for teaching me python (very cool)
+ I FORGOT THAT I USED [AMONG US](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) SOUND EFFECTS AND THE HIDE AND SEEK THEME FOR IT HOLLY SHIT FULL CREDIT TO INNERSLOTH PLEASE PLEASE DO CHECK OUT THE FULL OG SONG [RIGHT HERE](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1179032)

# How to setup the game :hammer_and_wrench:
_(If you want to modify the source code)_
Requirements : 
1) A code editor (Anything works I think) eg. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) ...
2) [Python](https://www.python.org/) - You CANNOT start editing the code without it
3) And all of this *(These are for windows users, put them in your Command Prompt)* :
```
  pip install requests
  pip install itertools
  pip install Pillow
  pip install pygame
  pip install opencv-python
```
4) Feel free to edit the python file in **Code/snekbkup.py** ! (that's the main file) using your favorite code editor! The files in **Code/OTHER** are random ass files that you can delete or whatever, they have nothing to do with the main file but i left them there for archival purposes !
# TO DO LIST :chair:
Finished and unfinished things I wanted the game to have!

> Currently finished:
<p>1. Add audio and game icon
<p>5. Add custom textures to the snake and board (maybe change textures when reaching a specific puncte)
<p>4. Add DMC puncte system
<p>3. Modify interface
  
> WIP / Unfinished
<p>Make it so that the cutscene runs in the same window as the game
<p>Implement restart function (press R to restart when you die)
<p>Fix crashing when closing cutscene
<p>2. Add main menu (Settings, custom keybinds and volume slider)
<p>6. Make it so that the game moves faster if you have more puncte
<p>7. (Maybe) Clean the code
<p>8. (Maybe) Add a neato shader to the gaem
